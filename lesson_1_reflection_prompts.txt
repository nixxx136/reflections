How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    It helps us to find a typo easier.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    You could always go back to the previous version to see some old functions or methods.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

	pros:
	You can use any editor you want.
	You can also use it offline.
    You can choose to save a version whenever you want.

    cons:
    Sometimes it is hard to decide when to commit, which will cause the commit becomes too small or too big.


Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Sometimes, there are more than one file in our repo, and they are connected with each other. so we need to saving mutiple files in one commit.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    Use git log command to see the version history.
    Then use git diff to see the difference between two versions.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    We can always go back to previous version of code to find where did we make a mistake.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    Trp my first repo.
